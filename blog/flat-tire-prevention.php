            <h2>Warning Signs of Tire Problems</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Steering Wheel Vibration</h3>
            <p>If you notice unusual vibrations in your steering wheel, especially on smooth roads like I-5 or I-205, this could indicate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tire imbalance</li>
                <li>Uneven tire wear</li>
                <li>Potential flat spot development</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Vehicle Pulling to One Side</h3>
            <p>When driving on straight roads like Highway 26 or SR-500, if your vehicle pulls to either side, you might have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Underinflated tire on one side</li>
                <li>Uneven tire wear</li>
                <li>Alignment issues affecting tire pressure</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Unusual Sounds</h3>
            <p>Listen for these sounds, particularly noticeable on quiet roads:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thumping or rhythmic noise while driving</li>
                <li>Squealing during turns</li>
                <li>Constant humming or buzzing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Visual Indicators</h3>
            <p>Regular visual inspections can reveal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bulges or bubbles in tire walls</li>
                <li>Visible nails or other objects</li>
                <li>Uneven tread wear patterns</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. Changes in Vehicle Handling</h3>
            <p>Pay attention to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decreased responsiveness in turns</li>
                <li>Longer braking distances</li>

            <h2>Prevention Tips for Portland and Vancouver Drivers</h2>
            
            <h3>Regular Pressure Checks</h3>
            <p>Our local weather changes can significantly affect tire pressure. Check your tires:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least once a month</li>
                <li>Before long trips</li>
                <li>When temperatures change significantly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rotation Schedule</h3>
            <p>Regular tire rotation helps prevent uneven wear:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rotate every 5,000-8,000 miles</li>
                <li>Check alignment during rotation</li>
                <li>Inspect for unusual wear patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Local Road Hazard Awareness</h3>
            <p>Be extra cautious of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Construction zones on I-5 and I-205</li>
                <li>Potholes after winter weather</li>
                <li>Light rail tracks in downtown Portland</li>
